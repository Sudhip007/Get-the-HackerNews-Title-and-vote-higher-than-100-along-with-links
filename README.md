# Get-the-HackerNews-Title-and-vote-higher-than-100-along-with-links
This is a python code which will fetch the details of news from hackernews website(first two pages). It provide you with the title, link and votes(points) in a sorted order(higher points to lower points)

So, with help of this code you can fetch news(hackernews) daily morning by runing the python file.

All you need to is to run the code in a python shell or any python editor.

Thank You. Have a good day.
